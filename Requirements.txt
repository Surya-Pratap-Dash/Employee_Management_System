Database

The `employee.db` file is typically stored in the same directory where your Python script or application is located. In the provided code, if you are running the Python script from a file named `employee_management_system.py` (or any other name with the `.py` extension), then the `employee.db` file will be created in the same directory as the script.

If you are using an integrated development environment (IDE) like PyCharm, the `employee.db` file will be generated in the project's root directory or the directory where your Python script is located.

To locate the `employee.db` file, you can follow these steps:

1. Check the Current Directory: Open your Python script (`employee_management_system.py`) or the file that contains the database connection (`db.py`). The `employee.db` file should be in the same directory as this script.

2. Verify the Database Connection: Check the `Database` class definition in the `db.py` file. Look for code that creates or connects to the SQLite database (`employee.db`). This code should contain the path where the database is stored.

3. Using File Explorer: You can also use your system's file explorer (Windows Explorer, Finder on macOS, or Nautilus on Linux) to manually search for the `employee.db` file in the directory where your Python script is located.

Please note that if the `employee.db` file doesn't exist yet, it will be created automatically when you run the Python script and perform database operations using the `Database` class.


SQLite CLI: If you prefer working with the command-line interface, you can use the SQLite command-line shell to view the database file. To do this, open the terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows), navigate to the directory containing employee.db, and run the sqlite3 command followed by the database file name. For example:

sqlite3 Employee.db


Here the table name is employees

(1) To show all the tables we can use the following command:-
.tables
(2) To select all the data from a table we can use the folowing command:-
SELECT * from employees
